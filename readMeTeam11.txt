HOW TO PLAY THE GAME 


To test the Ivanhoe game, we run the “serverStart” which opens up a Graphical User interface window(StartUp) located in the user interface package. 
This window contains a “START GAME” button. When this button is clicked, the player is directed to the Server window located in the user interface(ServerUI) which request the amount of clients(players) that can connect and also permits the server to run continuously. 
The player(client) is directed to the login page to enter his/her name and port number, with the ip address already implemented automatically. 
After entering the credentials of the player, a player(client) can connect to the game which opens up a game window which is implemented in the MyBoard class in the user interface package. 
The names of the respected players do not show up on the players label in the board until every player is connected to the game.


NOTE: To set number of players, please "for now" set it in the config class as we will hook all these up in the server GUI on iteration 2. Thank You!
